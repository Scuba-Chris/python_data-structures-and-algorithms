# Singly Linked List
This code challenge was my first time working with linked list. The singly linked list is a linked list that the nodes are only linked to the next node in the link.

## Challenge
The challenge was to create a progam that could insert a node at the beginning of a linked list. Another function of the program is to find out if a node is included in the list.

## Approach & Efficiency
The first thing I had to do to get started with building this program was draw it out. I need to visualize how the nodes worked with the list and what the functions needed to do. The Big O is O(1).

## API
No APIs were used for this program

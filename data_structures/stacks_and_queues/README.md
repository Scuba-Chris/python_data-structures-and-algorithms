# Stacks and Queues
Stacks and queues are both data structures. Stacks follow the concepts of FILO (first in first out) and LIFO(last in first out). Queues follow FIFO(first in first out) and LILO(last in last out)

## Challenge
The challege today was to write 2 classes one for stacks and one for queues. They both need methods to peek and see if the stack is empty.

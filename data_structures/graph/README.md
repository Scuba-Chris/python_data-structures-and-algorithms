# Graphs
This is the first steps into learning about working with graphs. We are going to implement our own graph and create a few methods to use with the graph.

## Challenge
For this challenge we are to create the classes and methods needed to implement a graph. We are to also have the methods to add a vertex or node to the graph, find the size, add edges, get all the nodes, and get all the neighbors from the graph.

## Approach & Efficiency
The implementation of a graph is pretty straight forward. I started off with creating two classes. One class for the graph and another for the vertexes. Within the Graph class there are five methods. The first method is add_node, which adds a node or vertex to the Graph. The second method is called size. It does exactly as you would think. It returns the size of the Graph. Then, there is the add_edge method. It is needed to add edges and weights between the nodes. They next two methods do exactly as they are named, get_node and get_neighbors.

## API
1. add_node - adds a node(vertex) to the graph
2. size - returns the size of the graph
3. add_edge - adds an edge and weight between the nodes
4. get_node - returns all of the nodes that are in the graph
5. get_neighbors - returns all of the neighbors for the given node.
